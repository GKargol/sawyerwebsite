# Personal Website for Sawyer MacLean

## Purpose

<p>While more of a surprise gift, the website is a fun challenge for myself. Creating it from scratch, it's been entertaining to customize, design, and learn new ways of doing things with HTML/CSS. Credit to my AI friend ChatGPT for helping to accurate the learning process.</p>

## Beta

<p>While the site seems fine now, it was built in around 3 hours during the first 6 ish commits. I plan to continue fixing and making the site clean. Will be interesting to see what I make.</p>
